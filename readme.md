# For artist
### Programs needed:
Git: [download git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)     
Unity 2020.3.5f1: [unity download](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)  
### Handy guide's:
A quick git guide: [git guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)   
### Handy programs:
Visual git: [Git kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download/windows64)

Do the following in the map where you want to have the project
``` 
> git clone "https://github.com/Go-to-space/Sky_High"
```
Make in git your own branch and work in there.  
Use unique names for your files.
So that we can avoid having files with the same name.
## If need in help ask devs
If you need help with git just ask your friendly neighbourhood developers.  
We don't bite.  
NOOOO we don't. ~~Yes, we do join us.~~ Just ask if you need help.  
They will always be prepared to help. Thats why the wrote me.
